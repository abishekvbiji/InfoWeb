        	    <h3 class="author">By Eric Portis </h3>
            	<p class="main_topic">Web developers spend their days writing hypertext, but, byte for byte, most of the web is composed of images. It is hard to overstate the effect that images have on the average web page’s performance; faster websites have broader reach and a higher impact. The first and most important thing you can do to improve the performance of your website’s images is figure out how to measure them.</p>

        	    <p class="sub_topic"> In computing, a web application or web app is a client–server software application in which the client (or user interface) runs in a web browser.[1] Common web applications include webmail, online retail sales, online auctions, wikis, instant messaging services and many other functions.

              <h3 class="author">By Evgeny Khrolenok & Igor Mikheiko</h3>
              <p class="main_topic">It wasn’t long after Hollywood released its first 3D films that the movie format quickly gained huge popularity worldwide. Thanks to developments in video-recording technology, any user can now shoot a video on their own. You can make a stereo record of memorable events in your life or create wonderful material for your business.</p>

              <img src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/shooting-process-500w-opt.jpg" width="500" height="284&quot;&quot;" class="topic_img" alt="How We Built An iOS App To Shoot A 3D Video (Case Study)">
       
              <p class="sub_topic"> Our team was also attracted to 3D filming. We thoroughly studied the features of the human visual apparatus and the technical details of stereoscopic photography. Then, we decided to develop an iOS app to shoot 3D videos and upload the videos to YouTube. The idea behind the app was to facilitate the shooting of 3D video by mounting two iPhones to a special frame — and we did it! That was how the Stereo Video Recorder app appeared.

         <h3 class="author">By Heydon Pickering</h3>
         <p class="main_topic">Some people hate writing documentation, and others just hate writing. I happen to love writing; otherwise, you wouldn't be reading this. It helps that I love writing because, as a design consultant offering professional guidance, writing is a big part of what I do. But I hate, hate, hate word processors.</p>

         <img src="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/markdown-shadowdom-preview-opt.png" width="500" height="222" class="topic_img" alt="Documenting Components In Markdown With Shadow DOM">
       
         <p class="sub_topic"> When writing technical web documentation (read: pattern libraries), word processors are not just disobedient, but inappropriate. Ideally, I want a mode of writing that allows me to include the components I'm documenting inline, and this isn't possible unless the documentation itself is made of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In this article, I'll be sharing a method for easily including code demos in Markdown, with the help of shortcodes and shadow DOM encapsulation.
